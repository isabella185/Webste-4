    <h1>The Orgins of the Months of January</h1>
    <h5>Isabella Hernandez</h5>
   <p>The day after Epiphany (January 6) was once called Distaff Day and marked when the women went back spinning after the 12-day Christmas celebration. A distaff is a wooden rod (staff) that holds flax or wool. Before the Spinning Wheel arrived, spinning was slowly and <b>tediously</b> done on a Drop Spindle. As is often the case, it’s hard to go back to work after the holidays and not much got done! The women’s husbands would <i>mischievously</i> try to set fire to the flax on their wives’ distaffs, while the women, lying in wait, would retaliate with humor by dousing them with buckets of water.</p>

    <p>Dating back to the fifteenth century, the first <b>Monday</b> after Epiphany (January 6) <i>marked</i> the start of the <i>agricultural</i> season, specifically for ploughing the fields for spring-sown crops. Of <b>course</b>, not much work was actually done on the first day! Dressed in clean white smocks decorated with ribbons, the men dragged a plow (plough) through the village and collected money for the “plow light” that was kept burning in the church all year. Often men from several farms joined together to pull the plow through all their villages. They sang and danced their way from village to village to the accompaniment of music. In the evening, each farmer provided a Plough Monday supper for his workers, with plentiful beef and ale for all.</p>
